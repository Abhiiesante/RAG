Task Title:
Agentic RAG Chatbot for Multi-Format Document QA using Model Context Protocol
(MCP)

Problem Statement:
You are required to build an agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot
that can answer user questions using uploaded documents of various formats. Your architecture
must follow an agentic structure and should incorporate Model Context Protocol (MCP) as
the mechanism for communication between agents and/or agents ↔ LLMs.

Core Functional Requirements
Your solution must:
1. Support Uploading & Parsing of Diverse Document Formats:
○ ✅ PDF
○ ✅ PPTX
○ ✅ CSV
○ ✅ DOCX
○ ✅ TXT / Markdown
2. Agentic Architecture (minimum 3 agents):
○ IngestionAgent: Parses & preprocesses documents.
○ RetrievalAgent: Handles embedding + semantic retrieval.
○ LLMResponseAgent: Forms final LLM query using retrieved context and generates
answer.
3. Use Model Context Protocol (MCP):
○ Each agent must send/receive messages using structured MCP-like context
objects, such as:
{
"sender": "RetrievalAgent",
"receiver": "LLMResponseAgent",
"type": "CONTEXT_RESPONSE",
"trace_id": "abc-123",
"payload": {
"top_chunks": ["...", "..."],
"query": "What are the KPIs?"
}
}

○ You can implement MCP using in-memory messaging, REST, or pub/sub.
4. Vector Store + Embeddings
○ Use any embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
○ Use a vector DB (FAISS, Chroma, etc.)
5. Chatbot Interface (UI)
○ Allow users to:
■ Upload documents
■ Ask multi-turn questions
■ View responses with source context
○ Use any UI framework: Streamlit, React, Angular, Flask, etc.

📸 Deliverables
1. 📁 GitHub Repository
○ Include:
■ Well-organized code
■ Clear README.md with setup instructions

2. 📊 PPT Presentation
○ Slide deck (3–6 slides) must include:
■ Agent-based architecture with MCP integration
■ System flow diagram (with message passing)
■ Tech stack used
■ 📸 UI screenshots of working app
■ Challenges Faced while doing the project
■ (Optional) future scope / improvements

3. 🔗 Submission
○ Share:
■ Public GitHub repository link
■ Architecture PPT (PDF or PPTX) [ To be included in the GitRepo Itself]
■ Include a Video for 5 mins where 1 min give the application demo, 2 min
architecture and flow explanation, 2 min code explanation. (Its optional to
show face)

🧠 Sample Workflow (Message Passing with MCP)
User uploads: sales_review.pdf, metrics.csv
User: "What KPIs were tracked in Q1?"
➡️ UI forwards to CoordinatorAgent
➡️ Coordinator triggers: 🔸 IngestionAgent → parses documents
🔸 RetrievalAgent → finds relevant chunks
🔸 LLMResponseAgent → formats prompt & calls LLM
➡️ Chatbot shows answer + source chunks

MCP message example:
{
"type": "RETRIEVAL_RESULT",
"sender": "RetrievalAgent",
"receiver": "LLMResponseAgent",
"trace_id": "rag-457",
"payload": {
"retrieved_context": ["slide 3: revenue up", "doc: Q1
summary..."],
"query": "What KPIs were tracked in Q1?"
}
}
